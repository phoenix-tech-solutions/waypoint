To obtain this Seal, students must demonstrate the determined level of proficiency in English, as well as one or more additional languages, be that language a native language, a heritage language, or a language learned in school or another setting. Some components for Georgia’s Seal of Biliteracy may be completed prior to high school for some students (as with dual language immersion programs, English learners, and other populations). The focus is on achieving the level of proficiency required for English and the level of proficiency required for one or more other languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS Innovation Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125 Milton AvenueAlpharettaGA30009470-254-5360470-254-5361\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook(opens in new window/tab)Twitter(opens in new window/tab)YouTube(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Website(opens in new window/tab)District Calendar(opens in new window/tab)Enroll Your Student(opens in new window/tab)Employee Hub(opens in new window/tab)Transportation(opens in new window/tab)Lunch Menu(opens in new window/tab)Student Records/Transcripts(opens in new window/tab)Open Records Request(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nAt Fulton County Schools, our mission is to educate every student to be a responsible, productive citizen.

The facility, staff and resources are available for student and teacher use for instructional purposes through-out each instructional day of the school year.\nSelection, Evaluation and Utilization of Instructional Materials\nEvery effort will be made to provide materials that present all points of view concerning the problems and issues of our times, international, national and local.\nBooks or other reading matter of sound factual authority shall not be prescribed or removed from library shelves or classrooms because of partisan, doctrinal approval or disapproval.\nNo parent or group of parents has the right to determine the reading matter for students other than their own children.\nThe Board does, however, recognize the right of an individual parent or guardian to request that his/her child not be required to read, view or listen to a given instructional material provided a written request is filed by the parent or guardian with the appropriate School District personnel.\nStudents and school personnel are accountable for proper care of instructional resources provided through the media center.\nHow the Process Works\nSelection of instructional materials and media center resources located in the media center program is overseen by the certified school library media specialist with input from the school media committee. (See Policy IFA) Materials and resources are selected to support curricula, instruction, and academic success for all students. Opportunities are provided for staff input for the evaluation of instructional media center resources by the appropriate grade level, content area specialist, or department chairperson.\n\nAll school-owned instructional resources are organized and managed through an electronic library media management system EXCEPT textbooks, deployed mobile devices, and ancillary materials purchased and used specifically with a textbook adoption.\n\t \nWorn or out-of-date items will be replaced as needed. Withdrawn materials will be sent to the ware-house for disposal.\n\t \nFees may be charged for lost or damaged instructional materials and resources.\n\t \nGift/donated items will be judged for appropriateness to the grade level and/or content area.\n\t \nStudents shall be provided instructional opportunities that are collaboratively planned, implemented, and assessed by a certified school library media specialist, in partnership with a classroom teacher, in order to increase information literacy skills and communication/technology skills for all K-12 learners. Each school shall provide all students with opportunities to develop information literacy skills.\n\t \n\t\nThe media specialist shall have the primary responsibility for planning with the teacher to link information resources and developing opportunities for students to apply these skills during instruction in the media center.\n\t\t \nThe media specialist shall have the responsibility for providing opportunities for instructional staff to acquire, develop, and improve their own information access skills and those of their students.\n\t\t \nThe classroom teacher shall have the primary responsibility for introducing to students all units of study in which the media specialist is involved.\n\t\t \n\n\nNon-school-owned materials may be used in the instructional program at the discretion of the local school administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS Innovation Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125 Milton AvenueAlpharettaGA30009470-254-5360470-254-5361\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook(opens in new window/tab)Twitter(opens in new window/tab)YouTube(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Website(opens in new window/tab)District Calendar(opens in new window/tab)Enroll Your Student(opens in new window/tab)Employee Hub(opens in new window/tab)Transportation(opens in new window/tab)Lunch Menu(opens in new window/tab)Student Records/Transcripts(opens in new window/tab)Open Records Request(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nAt Fulton County Schools, our mission is to educate every student to be a responsible, productive citizen.

However, students can participate in a GHSA sport at their home school as long as they are not already participating in eSports at IA. \nClick here for the FCS policy on Innovation Academy students playing sports at their home zoned schools.\nStudents need to work with the athletic department and coaches at their home school to find out about tryouts, practices, and any other procedures or policies surrounding the sport they want to participate in.\nOnce a student is accepted onto the team, the home school Athletic Director and Data Clerk will need to add a partial line of enrollment for the IA athlete so the home school has access to the student's records and contact information for athletic purposes.\nA student-athlete may be asked to complete the GHSA Transfer Student Eligibility Form and will need a copy of the policy statement showing that Innovation Academy students can play sports at their home school. This form should be completed by the home school.\nMost students will need to take a virtual class during 8th period in order to leave on time to participate in their home school sport. \n\nRequesting to take 8th period virtually - Virtual Period Change Request Form  - Contact Ms. Lundy if you are starting a spring sport and need to change your schedule.\nRequest to be off-campus during virtual period - Off Campus Contract Form.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrama Club\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS IA Drama Club\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS Innovation Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125 Milton AvenueAlpharettaGA30009470-254-5360470-254-5361\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook(opens in new window/tab)Twitter(opens in new window/tab)YouTube(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Website(opens in new window/tab)District Calendar(opens in new window/tab)Enroll Your Student(opens in new window/tab)Employee Hub(opens in new window/tab)Transportation(opens in new window/tab)Lunch Menu(opens in new window/tab)Student Records/Transcripts(opens in new window/tab)Open Records Request(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nAt Fulton County Schools, our mission is to educate every student to be a responsible, productive citizen.

This is a two-period class that we call GT block. Students earn credit for each of the three classes. They then choose which pathway they will complete while at IA. Many students choose to minor or double major in more than one pathway. Taking the GT block makes this possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Science\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Study\nStudents choose between four different Health Sciences tracks: Biotechnology, Patient Care, Surgical Tech, and EMT.\nState of the Art Equipment\nOur heath care equipment is state of the art representing real life scenarios with surgical rooms and practice mannequins, diagnostic equipment, and an in-house mock ambulance.\nExplore More in the Beacon\nVisit the Beacon, our newsletter written by students, to find out more about what is happening in the Health Sciences Pathway.\n\nStudents take charge during last year's Flex Friday Save-a-Life event during which health sciences students simulated a school-wide medical emergency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Study\nStudents learn about engineering technologies, including material science, biomedical, electrical, mechanical, mechatronics, aerospace, structural, and civil engineering, as well as learning about the engineering design process, biologically inspired design. Students have the opportunity to achieve certification in Solidworks CAD.\nExpanded Design and Lab space\nWhile other schools usually have one dedicated lab and classroom space for engineering students, FCS IA has 4 classrooms with 2,784 square feet of work space for students and 3 separate workshops in a dedicated wing of the building where students have easy access to taking their projects outside to work. Our engineering labs are stocked with 3 different types of 3D printers, a Laguna CNC router, Jet Metal lathe, Lonestar CNC spitfire plasma cutter, multimatic Miller Welder (allowing for 3 types of welding), augmented reality welding training system (so students learn to weld virtually first), 4 sewing machines, an embroidery machine, and a vinyl cutter and printer.\nExplore More in the Beacon\nVisit the Beacon, our newsletter written by students, to find out more about what is happening in the Engineering Pathway.\n\nSuited up for safety, an engineering student makes his mark at IA, designing prototypes that best meet the needs for his project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Study\nStudents can pursue concentrations in Computer Science, Game Design, Cybersecurity, and Embedded Computing.\nState of the Art Equipment\nOur game design lab is equipped with high end graphics and computing capabilities. The cybersecurity track features its own internal server for students to engage in simulated cyber security events. In 2025-26, Innovation Academy will become the first Fulton County School to offer an Artificial Intelligence track.\nExplore More in the Beacon\nVisit the Beacon, our newsletter written by students, to find out more about what is happening in the Information Technology Pathway.\n\nStudents cooperate to combine engineering and coding efforts to create a project for Flex Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlex Fridays\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Flex Friday?\n\n\nWhat to expect on Flex Friday?\n\n\nAttendance at Flex Fridays\n\n\nTypes of topics discussed on Flex Friday.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Flex Friday?\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Academy encourages our students and faculty to think outside the box. Our schedule and environment encourages that kind of innovation and flexible thinking. Monday through Thursday, students follow a traditional public-school schedule taking 7 academic courses with one additional period for lunch.  This leaves Fridays open for a variety of in-depth, hands-on learning opportunities, which we call Flex Fridays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to expect on Flex Friday?\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Flex Friday features a particular pathway and often includes cross-curricular workshops, field trips, and experiences outside of what’s usually taught in the traditional day-to-day classroom.  This is also an opportunity to bring in industry specialists in the fields of Engineering, IT and Health Science to run workshops on specific skills, information about the industry, or support an already scheduled workshop based on their expertise. \nFor example, our students have participated in learning events supported by our community partners, including Rocket Day (sponsored by Lockheed Martin) during which students built and launched hundreds of rockets, Raspberry Pi Day and Code for a Cause where students focused all day on personally designed software projects, and Save-A-Life, a mass casualty training sponsored by Wellstar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance at Flex Fridays\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents attend at least three Flex Fridays a semester on their designated pathway day with Freshmen attending on their designated freshman day. Students must earn 12 pathway credits a year as part of our magnet school requirements. Each Flex Friday offers two workshops worth one pathway credit each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of topics discussed on Flex Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Sampling of Topics Students Experience on Flex Fridays\n\n\n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\nHealth Science\n\n\n\n\n\nR-Coding for Data Visualization\nDigital Synthesizers\nIntro to Blender\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\nAutomotive Skills\nFood Engineering\nRobotics\nDrafting\n\n\n\n\nSuturing\nMedical Ethics Dissections\nMedication Safety\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Events for Super Flex Fridays\nDesigned to have students solve a problem using the \n\t\t\tDesign Thinking process.\n\n\n\n\nCode for a Cause\n\n\nCosmic Odyssey\n\n\nSave a Life Fair\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Key Components of the FCS IA Experience\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nAuthentic, Project-Based Learning\n\n\nDesign Thinking\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch is a big focus for our students. Every student takes an IA Research course their junior year where they are encouraged to collaborate in teams to complete their Pinnacle Project.  In addition, students can choose to pursue the AP Capstone diploma which starts with 10th graders taking AP Seminar as their 10th grade ELA class. AP Seminar is followed by IA Research in 11th, and AP Research in 12th.\nCompletion of the Pinnacle Research Project in 11th grade is one of the components of our magnet school requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentic, Project-Based Learning\n\n\n\n\n\nWe engage students with complex topics in real-world scenarios, ask them to apply their knowledge, and pursue their passions whenever possible so the learning is relevant to them.\nAddress Real-World Problems\nIA students interact with our community partners learning about actual problems community members are facing. For example, Fulton County Water Works worked with our freshman on Flex Fridays to talk about how natural and artificial water systems work.  Students sampled the ponds on our property to determine if the pond system is healthy. If the pond was not healthy, they suggested solutions to improve the water health.\nCross-Curricular Projects and Activities\nStudents work on real-world challenges like delivering medical supplies to areas where first responders cannot reach. Health Science experts determine what needs to be included in the first response kit. Engineers work on the specs needed for the box of supplies that are delivered via drone, and information technology specialists program the drones.\nWork in Teams\nStudents are encouraged to cooperate in teams to complete projects. Senior Simone W. explains: “We work on teams especially in my pathway classes. I’ve learned a lot about myself and how to work with different minds. I’m much more open and accepting to other people’s ideas now.”\nExplore more about our authentic learning experiences in the Beacon, our student written newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Thinking\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign Thinking is a method that uses a cyclical process to solve problems with the user in mind.  DT uses a series of steps that create specific work in each phase.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS Innovation Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125 Milton AvenueAlpharettaGA30009470-254-5360470-254-5361\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook(opens in new window/tab)Twitter(opens in new window/tab)YouTube(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Website(opens in new window/tab)District Calendar(opens in new window/tab)Enroll Your Student(opens in new window/tab)Employee Hub(opens in new window/tab)Transportation(opens in new window/tab)Lunch Menu(opens in new window/tab)Student Records/Transcripts(opens in new window/tab)Open Records Request(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nAt Fulton County Schools, our mission is to educate every student to be a responsible, productive citizen.

It's most convenient if you can go ahead and schedule it at the same time you schedule your child's well visit at the doctor. Local pharmacies may also provide this vaccine.\nWhen your child’s booster is done, please complete the Immunization Completion Form. You just need to provide your child’s name and birthdate and upload your form 3231.\nAny questions?

What happens next?\n\n\nHow do I enroll at IA?\n\n\n\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must complete an application to apply. We recommend reading through all instructions before clicking on the application link since students will need to prepare essays and a video that will be added to the application.\nDeadline to apply - January 15, 2024\n*You do not need to do the Change of School Assignment (COSA) process to apply to IA.\nApplication Link:\nhttps://form.jotform.com/243013632732144\nStudent Short Answer Questions and Video - Required\nTo help students think about whether or not FCS Innovation Academy is the right place for them, we ask them to answer two short answer questions and submit a short video of themselves.\nThese responses and the video should be ready to add to the application when you apply.\nPlan Ahead – Short Answer Prompts\nStudents should prepare answers to the short answer questions and create their video before starting the application. These are the prompts they will be answering.\nQuestion 1:\nAt FCS IA, we celebrate taking chances and applying our knowledge. With this in mind, reflect on a project or assignment you have done, either on your own or in school of which you are proud. Think about the project and pick one of the traits of an IA student and talk about how you exemplified or showed growth in that characteristic. The list of traits to choose from includes inquisitive, collaborative, creative, analytical, well-rounded, empathetic, flexible, and driven. Maximum words - 250.\nQuestion 2: \nWhat would you change about the project? Maximum words - 150.\nVideo Prompt\nVideo Length - No longer than 30 seconds.\nWhat to Include in Your Video\n1. For the video, students must start by introducing themselves and stating their names.\n2. Next, students should answer this question: Why do you want to attend FCS Innovation Academy?\nVideo File Specifications\nYou can choose to upload a file or share a link that is open to anyone in the public to view. If your file is larger than 10 MB, you will have to share a link and not upload a file. Videos taken on a PC or laptop, are usually smaller in size than videos taken on a phone.\nFile formats that we can accept include: mp4, wma, mpg, mpeg, avi, mov, and wmv.\nFCS Students Can Use Microsoft Stream\nIf you attend Fulton County Schools and have access to ClassLink, you can use Microsoft Stream to record your video. You can find Microsoft Stream under the Microsoft 365 folder. IMPORTANT: Make sure that when you share your video, that you choose to share it so ANYONE can view the link. Otherwise, we won't be able to watch your video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho can attend FCS IA?\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Academy is a magnet school serving all of the learning zones in north Fulton County Fulton (Learning Zones 4, 5, 6, or 7.)  To attend IA, you must be a Fulton County resident living in Fulton Learning Zone 4, 5, 6, or 7.\nStudents must apply to IA while they are in 8th grade. We only accept rising 9th grade students for admission. \nStudents zoned to attend the following high schools can attend IA: Alpharetta, Cambridge, Centennial, Chattahoochee, Johns Creek, Milton, North Springs, Northview, Riverwood, and Roswell.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do I apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application process opens on December 9th and concludes on January 15th. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've applied. What happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\nCompletion of Application Steps: Once your child has completed the online application, their name will be entered into a random lottery. This lottery is conducted to ensure a fair and equitable selection process for all applicants.\nAcceptance Emails: Following the lottery, FCS IA will send out an acceptance email on Friday, January 31st, to the first group of students who have been selected. We are thrilled at the prospect of welcoming new students to our community and are eager to see the unique contributions they will bring.\nWait List: Students not included in the initial group of acceptances will be placed on a wait list. Please be assured that being on the wait list does not reflect on your child’s qualifications or potential.\nEnrollment Decisions: The first round of students will have the opportunity to either accept the invitation and enroll or decline. We understand that this is an important decision for your family, and we encourage you to consider the opportunity carefully.\nFurther Invitations: Based on the number of students who accept the invitation, we will extend additional invitations to students from the wait list to enroll at Innovation Academy. Our goal is to fill our classrooms with enthusiastic learners, and we hope to offer this opportunity to as many students as possible.\nRounds of Acceptance: Typically, we conduct three main rounds of acceptance. Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional rounds. We will keep you informed every step of the way.\nSiblings: We try to keep siblings together so if a rising freshman has a sibling who will be enrolled at IA next year when the student enrolls as a freshman, then the student will bypass the lottery. Rising freshman who have siblings who are currently seniors and will not have a sibling enrolled at IA next year will enter the lottery the same as everyone else. Siblings must complete an application to attend IA to be considered for enrollment. This sibling consideration is not automatically applied each year and can change in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I enroll at IA?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are delighted that you are considering FCS Innovation Academy (FCS IA) for your child’s educational journey. As a magnet school, we have a unique application and enrollment process designed to be a fair admissions process for our diverse group of student applicants.\nApplication Requirement: Please be reminded that completion of the application process is mandatory for all prospective students. Enrollment at FCS IA is by invitation only.\nAcceptance Email: When you are accepted as part of the lottery process, you will receive an email with detailed instructions on how to proceed with enrollment at IA. This email will serve as your guide through the final steps of joining our community.\nEnrollment Instructions: For those not currently enrolled in Fulton County, the acceptance email will include steps on how to officially enroll in Fulton County Schools. If your child is already a Fulton County student, the instructions will facilitate the transfer of their official enrollment from their home school to Innovation Academy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS Innovation Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125 Milton AvenueAlpharettaGA30009470-254-5360470-254-5361\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook(opens in new window/tab)Twitter(opens in new window/tab)YouTube(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Website(opens in new window/tab)District Calendar(opens in new window/tab)Enroll Your Student(opens in new window/tab)Employee Hub(opens in new window/tab)Transportation(opens in new window/tab)Lunch Menu(opens in new window/tab)Student Records/Transcripts(opens in new window/tab)Open Records Request(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nAt Fulton County Schools, our mission is to educate every student to be a responsible, productive citizen.

Finding the right school for you.\nFirst of all, do not buy-in to the idea that there is only one correct school for you. Students can find happiness and success at more than one school. Focus on creating a list of the best choices for you. To create a list, do your research and attend events where you can learn about your options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a List\n\n\nDo Your Research\n\n\nGAFutures.Org is a Must-Visit Website\n\n\nAttend College Visits at IA\n\n\nPlan a Trip  to Visit College Campuses\n\n\nCatch a Community-Sponsored College Info Session/Fair\n\n\nSchedule an Appointment with Our IA College & Career Advisor\n\n\n\n\nCreate a List\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should you consider when you build your list?\nBack-Up, Match, and Reach Schools\nA good piece of advice is to design a list with back-up, match, and reach schools? A back-up school is a school where your academic course load, grades and college standardized test scores are at the top end of the accepted student's profile or a school that accepts most students who apply. A match school is a school where your academic and extracurricular profile falls into the middle to top range of accepted student profiles. This is a school where you fit the profile and have a good chance of being accepted. A reach school is a school that is extremely competitive like an Ivy league school or a school where your academic and extra-curricular profile is below or at the low-end of the accepted student profiles.\nDetermine What is Important to You\nWhat is important to you? Small class sizes? Big football? A specific major? Staying close to home? Moving somewhere new? A big or small school? Cost of your education? Study abroad programs? Help in finding a job for after graduation?\nThe ACT offers great information on creating a list and choosing candidate schools that would be a good fit for you.\nArticle on Finding the Best Schools for You\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Your Research\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Naviance and Internet Searches to Research Colleges\nIn addition to searching the internet for searching for and learning about schools, Fulton County also offers a college and career resource called Naviance. Naviance is a comprehensive college and career readiness solution that helps districts and schools align student strengths and interests to post-secondary goals. Naviance offers the following:​\n\n\nStudents can sign up for on-campus college rep visits on this site.\n\n\nRobust tools to help students find colleges and universities that meet their needs.\n\n\nMultiple assessments are offered that guide students in self-discovery and career planning.\n\nStudents login to Naviance using ClassLink.\n\nFulton County Schools no longer uses Naviance for the college application process. Please go to the appropriate college application source and follow those directions.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAFutures.Org is a Must-Visit Website\n\n\n\n\n\nGAFutures.org is a Must-Visit Website for all GA Students\nGAFutures.org is a website hosted by the Georgia Student Finance Commission (GSFC). All Georgia students should create an account on GAFutures to research colleges, scholarships, HOPE, financial aid, and more. These are a few helpful links.\nCollege Search on GAFutures.org\nUse GAFutures to research college options.\nGeorgia Match\nGeorgia Match is a new program introduced in 2023 that is designed to match Georgia graduates to a Georgia school based on HOPE GPA. GAFutures.org tells you all you need to know about the Georgia Match initiative.\nCreate a GAFutures.org Account\n(or Recover a Forgotten Username/Password)\nIf you want to check your HOPE GPA, apply to Georgia schools through GAFutures, or apply for Dual Enrollment, you will need a GAFutures account. To create an account, go the GAFutures.org website and click on the Create an Account button. There will also be options for forgotten passwords and usernames of you already have an account that you don't remember your credentials for.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend College Visits at IA\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout College Visits at IA\nEvery fall, admissions counselors from colleges and universities across the country come to IA to talk about their school. Take advantage of finding out more about these schools without having to leave Innovation Academy's campus. Admissions counselors share the scoop on campus life, tips for applying, and anything else you want to ask about. College information sessions are open to students in grades 10th, 11th, and 12th grade. \nSign up for College visits at IA. Appointments are OPEN!\nIt's easy to find a schedule of schools and to register to attend.\n\nSimply log-in to Naviance through ClassLink. \nPick Colleges from the top menu bar and then click on College Visits.\nYou will then see the whole list of colleges coming to IA. \nRemember to get your teacher's permission to attend the session if you will be missing their class.\n\nDetailed Instructions for Registering for a College Visit\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan a Trip  to Visit College Campuses\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a Campus Tour\nOnce you've started focusing in on some schools that you are interested, plan a trip or more to go onto a school's campus and take a tour. You'll need to sign up for a tour ahead of time. These can get full so plan ahead. Schools often offer sessions from specific departments and majors that you can also sign up for. Long weekends and spring break of your junior year are great times to plan for a trip. \nTaking a Tour While IA is in Session\nSometimes, it doesn't work out to take a tour while you are on break. You can still take a tour on campus. You must complete a Pre-Approved Absence Form and have it signed by school administration. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch a Community-Sponsored College Info Session/Fair\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Events Around Town\nCommunity organizations and colleges themselves often host college fairs and information sessions. These can be in person events in the metro Atlanta area or virtual sessions. Clusters of schools with similar profiles or geographical locations often travel together to different cities to host information sessions. Ivy league schools are less likely to attend each local high school, instead they will pick one or two locations in town and invite the entire student community to attend. Registration is usually required. \nSearch your targeted schools' websites for information on how to visit or whether they have information sessions in the Atlanta area.\nIf we hear about an information session, we will post it.\nPROBE Fair\nMany organizations host college fairs, but PROBE is an organization that usually hosts several in our area every year. Check out the PROBE website for information about PROBE and a schedule of local fairs.\nEvents To Check Out\nPeach State Tour\nJoin Augusta University, Georgia State University, Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia this fall (August 27-September 26) for the Peach State Tour! Please click on the link below to register and find out more information.

This means you must apply through GAFutures by March 31st and complete the Fulton County DE form. However, Georgia Tech typically opens their online application on May 15th so you won't be able to apply to GT until then.  Their application deadline is June 15th.  They will release admissions decisions  for fall applicants in July after they receive AP scores.\n\n\nGeorgia Tech's Distance Math program - https://dev.admission.gatech.edu/dual-enrollment/distance-math\n\n\nInformation on all of Georgia Tech's Dual Enrollment Programs - https://admission.gatech.edu/dual-enrollment/\n\n\nGeorgia Tech Computer Science CS 1301 and CS 1331 - GT is now offering this program over the summer.

Student's are automatically enrolled in their zoned home school and high schools can begin processing their schedule requests at the same time as their currently enrolled students.

The following are resources from that meeting.\nGSFC Slide Presentation Fall 2023\nFederal Financial Aid Website\nHow-to Create a FAFSA ID\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholarships\n\n\n\n\n\nScholarship Tips:\n\n\nFocus on one or two scholarship websites/apps to make the process more manageable. Naviance, Gafutures.org, Scholly.com and Scholaroo.com are great options to search for scholarships geared toward your interests.\n\n\nRemember that many colleges and universities offer merit-based scholarships during the application process. Merit scholarships may be given out automatically to students who meet a specific GPA and test score criteria or awarded through a formal application process.\n\n\nLook at local scholarships offered through civic organizations or local businesses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOPE and Zell Miller Scholarship\n\n\n\n\n\nHOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships are provided to students who are Georgia residents and have demonstrated academic achievement. This money goes toward paying all or a portion of a student's tuition at a public State of Georgia institution and some private Georgia-based institutions. To find out more about HOPE eligibility, visit the GAfutures website. \nStudents must provide a valid Social Security Number to be considered for the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships. When you login to GAfutures, the system will be unable to calculate your HOPE GPA to determine eligibility unless you have submitted a valid Social Security Card and number to the counseling office. The Georgia Student Finance Commission uses the Social Security Number to link to the transcript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAFSA - Federal Application for Federal Student Aid\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FAFSA (Federal Application for Federal Student Aid) is a free application and must be completed to qualify for federal financial aid. This form must be completed every year. You must complete either the FAFSA or the GSFAPP (Georgia Student Finance Application) to be eligible for the HOPE scholarship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSFAPP - Georgia Student Finance Application\n\n\n\n\n\nGSFAPP (Georgia Student Finance Application) is one of the forms you can use to apply for HOPE and the Zell Miller scholarship. This application only needs to be completed once every 10 years. This application submits your information for the HOPE and Zell scholarships but does not qualify you for any federal financial aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Workshops / Events\n\n\n\n\n\nPeachtree Planning Workshops\n\n \nGeorgia Student Finance Commission Providing Financial Aid Sessions\nDo you need help filling out the FAFSA?

You can start attending information sessions with college admissions counselors on campus at Innovation Academy starting in your sophomore year. Here is a list of steps for applying to college and a recommended timeline for completing the items.\nCollege Application Steps & Timeline\nWe've provided some helpful information on how to start your search and do your research.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Standardized Tests for College Admissions (PSAT/SAT/ACT)\n\n\n\n\n\nPSAT\n\n\nThe PSAT is a standardized test usually taken in 10th or 11th grade.\n\n\nThe PSAT lasts just under three hours and tests your math, reading, and writing abilities.\n\n\nThe exam is designed to prepare you for the SAT and gauge college readiness.\n\n\nIt's also the qualifying exam for National Merit Scholarships for students taking it during 11th grade.\n\n\nFulton County Schools pays for students in 9th, 10th, and 11th grade to take the PSAT. \n\n\nThe PSAT is typically administered in October.\n\n\nArticle About the PSAT\nSAT\nThe SAT is an entrance exam used by most colleges and universities to make admissions decisions. The SAT is a multiple-choice, computer-based test created and administered by the College Board. \n\nThe SAT evaluates prospective college students' math, reading, and writing skills.\nThe popular college entrance exam takes three hours and consists of over 150 questions.\nStarting in 2024, the SAT will go digital, cut the number of questions, and take just two hours.\n\nStudents typically take the SAT in their Junior year or summer before senior year.\nArticle About the SAT\nACT\n\nThe ACT is one of the most popular standardized college entrance exams in the U.S.\nThe three-hour test measures college readiness in English, math, reading, and science.\nTest-takers can also sit for an optional essay section.\nScoring well on the ACT is a strong indicator of success your first year of college.\n\nArticle About the ACT\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Preparation for College Admissions Tests\n\n\n\n\n\nFree ACT and SAT Test Prep\n\n\nKhan Academy offers free personalized practice for the SAT. khanacademy.org/sat.\n\n\nFree ACT help through ACT \n\n\nFree SAT and ACT test prep is available through Streamable Learning. To access the videos, go to Classlink> Safari Montage> Streamable Learning> Recordings> Choose ACT Prep or SAT Prep and Submit.\n\n\nThe Atlanta-Fulton Public library offers free test prep. You must have an active AFPLS library card. Go to https://www.fulcolibrary.org/ and then Service> Digital Library> For Teens> College Prep.  Scroll down for two options: Learning Express and Peterson’s Test Prep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon App v. Coalition App v. Common Black College App\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Common App and Coalition for College are two different organizations that offer a standardized streamlined application process. Some colleges and universities participate in only one application. Others participate in both. Explore their websites and find out which platform features the colleges and universities you would like to apply to. Choose the one with the most schools you are interested in and complete the core part of that application over the summer. Work on both if it looks like you'll need to apply through both.\nThe Common Black College Application is an affordable college application that can be used to apply to multiple HBCUs across the country - all at once. Using this application is a great option for students who want to apply to HBCUs while cutting down on traditionally high college application costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips & Info You'll Need to Complete Your Applications\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've created a one-page Q&A with important information on how to complete your applications. You'll get answers to questions about information such as class rank, class size, and sending ACT, SAT, and AP test scores. We recommend you read this before starting your applications.\nQ&A for Completing Your Application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Letter Recommendation Process\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Obtain Teacher Approval Before Summer Break\nStep 2: Complete Brag Sheet(s)\n\n\nFillable Teacher Brag Sheet\n\n\nFillable Counselor Brag Sheet\n\n\nStep 3: Upload your Brag Sheet and Submit Request\n\n\nClick Here For The Recommendation Request Form\n\n\nStep 4: Follow instructions in the college's application platform to invite your teacher or counselor to submit your letter of recommendation.\nDeadline to request letters of recommendation process is June 15th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Request a Transcript\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation Academy Seniors Transcript Requests\n\n\nIf you are applying through the Common App, Black Common App, or Coalition App (SCOIR), you do not need to request a transcript. Your counselor will be notified by the system that they need to upload your transcript.\n\n\nIf you are applying through GAFutures, you can request your transcript through GAFutures.\n\n\nIf you are not using one of the methods listed above, or are applying to a program or scholarship, request your transcript through ScribOrder. If you are requesting to have a transcript sent directly to a college, choose Educational Institution from the Address Type drop down menu. If you need the transcript emailed to an organization, but you are requesting it, you must type in the email address where it needs to go under the Special Instructions section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshops & Info Sessions\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we learn about workshops and info sessions that help you with the college application process, we will post them here.\nGeorgia Student Finance Commission Providing Financial Aid Sessions\nDo you need help filling out the FAFSA?

Students with a break of enrollment for any reason will not be eligible for return. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Compliance \n\n\n\n\n\nBecause IA is a learning environment focused on STEM-based learning, students are provided wider access to technology and technology resources than the typical student.  Students are expected to conform their behavior while using technology to District standards and demonstrate ethical and legal practices.  As such, any behavior that is: \n\nAny unethical or suspected unethical use of technology resources that would negatively impact the school environment.\nAny behavior that results in the District’s determination that a student’s ability to use technology resources or the District’s Enterprise Network should be suspended, altered, or terminated, and/or\nAny behavior that results in the District’s determination that a student’s ability to use technology resources or the District’s Enterprise Network should be suspended, altered, or terminated, and/or\nDeemed a violation of the Responsible Use Agreement (Policy IFBGA)\nDeemed a violation of the Device User Agreement,\n\nmay result in the student’s removal from or non-admittance to IA and placement back in their home school, at the discretion of the District Superintendent or designee. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure of core content courses will trigger an administrative review, and the student may be placed on probation or removed from the magnet program and returned to the student’s zoned school. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisciplinary Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nAll students must comply with the district code of conduct (Operating Guideline JD: FCS CODE OF CONDUCT). Students that accrue repeated behavior referrals of Tier I or Tier II offenses will be subject to an enrollment review including possible probation or withdrawal.  Any student who receives a long-term suspension or expulsion will lose their privilege to attend. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendance Requirements \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe student must maintain an attendance rate of 90% or higher.\nThe student must not have more than ten late arrivals or early checkouts per year.\n\t\nMedical reasons may be approved by administration.\n\n\n\nStudents who do not meet these requirements will have an administrative review, and the student may be placed on probation or removed from the magnet program and returned to the student’s zoned school. \nAny extended absence should be pre-approved by the principal or the principal's designee to avoid being placed on probation.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload a PDF of the FCS IA Magnet Requirements\n\n\n\n\nState of Georgia Graduation Requirements\nInformation on Credits needed to Graduate\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCS Innovation Academy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125 Milton AvenueAlpharettaGA30009470-254-5360470-254-5361\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook(opens in new window/tab)Twitter(opens in new window/tab)YouTube(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nDistrict Website(opens in new window/tab)District Calendar(opens in new window/tab)Enroll Your Student(opens in new window/tab)Employee Hub(opens in new window/tab)Transportation(opens in new window/tab)Lunch Menu(opens in new window/tab)Student Records/Transcripts(opens in new window/tab)Open Records Request(opens in new window/tab)\n\n\n\n\nAt Fulton County Schools, our mission is to educate every student to be a responsible, productive citizen.
