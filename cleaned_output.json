Students with a break of enrollment for any reason will not be eligible for return.\nAttendance Requirements\n\nThe student must maintain an attendance rate of 90% or higher\nThe student must not have more than ten late arrivals or early checkouts per year Medical reasons may be approved by administration\n\nStudents who do not meet these requirements will have an administrative review, and the student may be placed on probation or removed from the magnet program and returned to the student’s zoned school.\nAny extended absence should be pre-approved by the principal or the principal's designee to avoid being placed on probation.\nMake-Up Work Policy\nStudents should refer to the syllabus and teacher for the make-up work policy for the class they are taking.\nHowever, here is a general guideline for make-up work at IA.\nMissing Work\nStudents will have equal number of days they are absent to complete any work or take any assessments for full credit whether the absence is excused or unexcused.\nMissing work will be labeled in Canvas with a zero and comment of Missing. that will reflect a zero in the gradebook until it is completed. The zero will be put in within two days of the absence to ensure parents and students can see their accurate grade in Canvas.\nPlease check the classroom syllabus to determine the due date to submit missing work for partial credit.\nLate Work\nIf a student is present in class and does not turn assignments at the end of class as required, the assignment will be considered late.\nIf a student does not turn in their work from an absence or make up an assessment within equal number of days they are absent, the assignment or assessment will be considered late. All late work should be turned in by the end of the unit.\nA deduction of 10 points will be applied to all late work.\nUntil the late work is turned in, a zero will be in Canvas. A comment of Missing will be added. Once the work is completed, the zero will be removed, the grade will be entered, and a flag of Late will be added in Canvas.\nOff-Campus Permission Request Form\nVirtual Period Change Request Form\nPre-Approved Absences\nStudents need to submit a Pre-Approved Absence Form for college visits, important family events, important religious holidays, or non-school academic-related event.\nImportant family events does not include vacations.\nPer Fulton County School Board Policy Code JBD:\n“Students/families must formally request for students to be absent for family events or other pre-approved absences.  These requests should be made five school days in advance of the absence.  Schools should create their own procedures to collect and approve requests for absences related to family events and/or other pre-approved absences.  Only the principal or assistant principal(s) can approve these absence requests.\nBefore approving these requests, school administration should consider the student’s complete attendance record including excused, unexcused, disciplinary, or other absence types.  The school administration should also consider the student’s academic standing before approving these absences.”\nPlease click HERE for a copy of the pre-approved absence form.\nIf you have any questions regarding this process, please email IAattendance@fultonschools.org. \nMorning Arrival Procedures\nMorning Arrival Procedures\nStudents must have lanyards present and visible on them through the duration of the entire school day. \nARRIVAL:\n\nStudents riding a bus will enter through the back door\nStudents being dropped off by car, will enter through the front door and follow the carpool guidelines\nStudents arriving at school during 1st period, 8:55-9:45 will enter through the back door and need to show their lanyard to our Campus Security Office to enter the building and sign in.  We do not ring the back doorbell. \n    _  If the student does not have their lanyard, they must check-in through the front office.\nAny student who arrives after 2nd period begins, must enter through the front office. \n    --  Students are not to ring the back doorbell to enter through the building\n\n4th and 5th Period Lunch:\n\nStudents are not able to go to their car during 4th and 5th period.  \n\nSpring Break\n\nAll Fulton County Schools and Administrative Offices will be closed April 7 through April 11 for Spring Break.
