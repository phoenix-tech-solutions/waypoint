The facility, staff and resources are available for student and teacher use for instructional purposes through-out each instructional day of the school year.\nSelection, Evaluation and Utilization of Instructional Materials\nEvery effort will be made to provide materials that present all points of view concerning the problems and issues of our times, international, national and local.\nBooks or other reading matter of sound factual authority shall not be prescribed or removed from library shelves or classrooms because of partisan, doctrinal approval or disapproval.\nNo parent or group of parents has the right to determine the reading matter for students other than their own children.\nThe Board does, however, recognize the right of an individual parent or guardian to request that his/her child not be required to read, view or listen to a given instructional material provided a written request is filed by the parent or guardian with the appropriate School District personnel.\nStudents and school personnel are accountable for proper care of instructional resources provided through the media center.\nHow the Process Works\nSelection of instructional materials and media center resources located in the media center program is overseen by the certified school library media specialist with input from the school media committee. (See Policy IFA) Materials and resources are selected to support curricula, instruction, and academic success for all students. Opportunities are provided for staff input for the evaluation of instructional media center resources by the appropriate grade level, content area specialist, or department chairperson.\n\nAll school-owned instructional resources are organized and managed through an electronic library media management system EXCEPT textbooks, deployed mobile devices, and ancillary materials purchased and used specifically with a textbook adoption.\n\nWorn or out-of-date items will be replaced as needed.

Each school shall provide all students with opportunities to develop information literacy skills.\n\nThe media specialist shall have the primary responsibility for planning with the teacher to link information resources and developing opportunities for students to apply these skills during instruction in the media center.\n\nThe media specialist shall have the responsibility for providing opportunities for instructional staff to acquire, develop, and improve their own information access skills and those of their students.\n\nThe classroom teacher shall have the primary responsibility for introducing to students all units of study in which the media specialist is involved.\n\n\n\nNon-school-owned materials may be used in the instructional program at the discretion of the local school administrator."
