# Waypoint: Find your way at IA

Waypoint is a project designed to enhance navigation and accessibility within the IA ecosystem. It combines intuitive user interfaces with advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models to deliver seamless user experiences. Our goal is to provide accurate, context-aware assistance for users, ensuring they can find the information they need efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Chat Interface**: A responsive and user-friendly chat system for real-time assistance.
- **RAG Model**: A robust pipeline for data ingestion, retrieval, and answer generation.
- **Teacher, Staff, and Club Directories**: Comprehensive indexes to help users quickly find relevant personnel or organizations.
- **Timeline**: A visual representation of events and milestones to keep users informed and organized.
- **Accounts Feature**: A secure user accounts system to enable personalized experiences and support future expansions. We imagine several ways in which this project may continue, so keeping the system modular and scalable will allow for seamless integration of new features.
