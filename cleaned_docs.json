Missing Work Students will have equal number of days they are absent to complete any work or take any assessments for full credit whether the absence is excused or unexcused. Missing work will be labeled in Canvas with a zero and comment of Missing. that will reflect a zero in the gradebook until it is completed. The zero will be put in within two days of the absence to ensure parents and students can see their accurate grade in Canvas. Please check the classroom syllabus to determine the due date to submit missing work for partial credit. Late Work If a student is present in class and does not turn assignments at the end of class as required, the assignment will be considered late. If a student does not turn in their work from an absence or make up an assessment within equal number of days they are absent, the assignment or assessment will be considered late. All late work should be turned in by the end of the unit. A deduction of 10 points will be applied to all late work. Until the late work is turned in, a zero will be in Canvas. A comment of Missing will be added. Once the work is completed, the zero will be removed, the grade will be entered, and a flag of Late will be added in Canvas. Off-Campus Permission Request Form IA Virtual Lab Off-Campus Contract Virtual Period Change Request Form Virtual Period Change Request Form Pre-Approved Absences Students need to submit a Pre-Approved Absence Form for college visits, important family events, important religious holidays, or non-school academic-related event.

Only the principal or assistant principal(s) can approve these absence requests. Before approving these requests, school administration should consider the student’s complete attendance record including excused, unexcused, disciplinary, or other absence types.

The facility, staff and resources are available for student and teacher use for instructional purposes through-out each instructional day of the school year. Selection, Evaluation and Utilization of Instructional Materials Every effort will be made to provide materials that present all points of view concerning the problems and issues of our times, international, national and local. Books or other reading matter of sound factual authority shall not be prescribed or removed from library shelves or classrooms because of partisan, doctrinal approval or disapproval. No parent or group of parents has the right to determine the reading matter for students other than their own children. The Board does, however, recognize the right of an individual parent or guardian to request that his/her child not be required to read, view or listen to a given instructional material provided a written request is filed by the parent or guardian with the appropriate School District personnel. Students and school personnel are accountable for proper care of instructional resources provided through the media center. How the Process Works Selection of instructional materials and media center resources located in the media center program is overseen by the certified school library media specialist with input from the school media committee. (See Policy IFA) Materials and resources are selected to support curricula, instruction, and academic success for all students. Opportunities are provided for staff input for the evaluation of instructional media center resources by the appropriate grade level, content area specialist, or department chairperson. All school-owned instructional resources are organized and managed through an electronic library media management system EXCEPT textbooks, deployed mobile devices, and ancillary materials purchased and used specifically with a textbook adoption. Worn or out-of-date items will be replaced as needed. Withdrawn materials will be sent to the ware-house for disposal. Fees may be charged for lost or damaged instructional materials and resources. Gift/donated items will be judged for appropriateness to the grade level and/or content area.",
    "Students shall be provided instructional opportunities that are collaboratively planned, implemented, and assessed by a certified school library media specialist, in partnership with a classroom teacher, in order to increase information literacy skills and communication/technology skills for all K-12 learners. Each school shall provide all students with opportunities to develop information literacy skills. The media specialist shall have the primary responsibility for planning with the teacher to link information resources and developing opportunities for students to apply these skills during instruction in the media center. The media specialist shall have the responsibility for providing opportunities for instructional staff to acquire, develop, and improve their own information access skills and those of their students. The classroom teacher shall have the primary responsibility for introducing to students all units of study in which the media specialist is involved. Non-school-owned materials may be used in the instructional program at the discretion of the local school administrator.

However, students can participate in a GHSA sport at their home school as long as they are not already participating in eSports at IA. Click here for the FCS policy on Innovation",
    "Academy students playing sports at their home zoned schools. Students need to work with the athletic department and coaches at their home school to find out about tryouts, practices, and any other procedures or policies surrounding the sport they want to participate in. Once a student is accepted onto the team, the home school Athletic Director and Data Clerk will need to add a partial line of enrollment for the IA athlete so the home school has access to the student's records and contact information for athletic purposes. A student-athlete may be asked to complete the GHSA Transfer Student Eligibility Form and will need a copy of the policy statement showing that Innovation Academy students can play sports at their home school. This form should be completed by the home school. Most students will need to take a virtual class during 8th period in order to leave on time to participate in their home school sport. Requesting to take 8th period virtually - Virtual Period Change Request Form - Contact Ms. Lundy if you are starting a spring sport and need to change your schedule. Request to be off-campus during virtual period - Off Campus Contract Form.

STEM Pathways Pursuing a STEM Pathway Health Science Engineering Information Technology Pursuing a STEM Pathway Our freshmen start by taking the introductory class in each of the three STEM pathways Innovation Academy offers - Health Sciences, Engineering, and Information Technology. This is a two-period class that we call GT block. Students earn credit for each of the three classes. They then choose which pathway they will complete while at IA. Many students choose to minor or double major in more than one pathway. Taking the GT block makes this possible. Health Science Areas of Study Students choose between four different Health Sciences tracks: Biotechnology, Patient Care, Surgical Tech, and EMT. State of the Art Equipment Our heath care equipment is state of the art representing real life scenarios with surgical rooms and practice mannequins, diagnostic equipment, and an in-house mock ambulance. Explore More in the Beacon Visit the Beacon, our newsletter written by students, to find out more about what is happening in the Health Sciences Pathway. Students take charge during last year's Flex Friday Save-a-Life event during which health sciences students simulated a school-wide medical emergency. Engineering Areas of Study Students learn about engineering technologies, including material science, biomedical, electrical, mechanical, mechatronics, aerospace, structural, and civil engineering, as well as learning about the engineering design process, biologically inspired design. Students have the opportunity to achieve certification in Solidworks CAD. Expanded Design and Lab space While other schools usually have one dedicated lab and classroom space for engineering students, FCS IA has 4 classrooms with 2,784 square feet of work space for students and 3 separate workshops in a dedicated wing of the building where students have easy access to taking their projects outside to work. Our engineering labs are stocked with 3 different types of 3D printers, a Laguna CNC router, Jet Metal lathe, Lonestar CNC spitfire plasma cutter, multimatic Miller Welder (allowing for 3 types of welding), augmented reality welding training system (so students learn to weld virtually first), 4 sewing machines, an embroidery machine, and a vinyl cutter and printer.

Suited up for safety, an engineering student makes his mark at IA, designing prototypes that best meet the needs for his project. Information Technology Areas of Study Students can pursue concentrations in Computer Science, Game Design, Cybersecurity, and Embedded Computing. State of the Art Equipment Our game design lab is equipped with high end graphics and computing capabilities. The cybersecurity track features its own internal server for students to engage in simulated cyber security events. In 2025-26, Innovation Academy will become the first Fulton County School to offer an Artificial Intelligence track.

Attendance at Flex Fridays Types of topics discussed on Flex Friday. What is Flex Friday? Innovation Academy encourages our students and faculty to think outside the box. Our schedule and environment encourages that kind of innovation and flexible thinking. Monday through Thursday, students follow a traditional public-school schedule taking 7 academic courses with one additional period for lunch. This leaves Fridays open for a variety of in-depth, hands-on learning opportunities, which we call Flex Fridays. What to expect on Flex Friday? Each Flex Friday features a particular pathway and often includes cross-curricular workshops, field trips, and experiences outside of what’s usually taught in the traditional day-to-day classroom. This is also an opportunity to bring in industry specialists in the fields of Engineering, IT and Health Science to run workshops on specific skills, information about the industry, or support an already scheduled workshop based on their expertise. For example, our students have participated in learning events supported by our community partners, including Rocket Day (sponsored by Lockheed Martin) during which students built and launched hundreds of rockets, Raspberry Pi Day and Code for a Cause where students focused all day on personally designed software projects, and Save-A-Life, a mass casualty training sponsored by Wellstar. Attendance at Flex Fridays Students attend at least three Flex Fridays a semester on their designated pathway day with Freshmen attending on their designated freshman day. Students must earn 12 pathway credits a year as part of our magnet school requirements. Each Flex Friday offers two workshops worth one pathway credit each. Types of topics discussed on Flex Friday.

    "IA Experience Research Authentic, Project-Based Learning Design Thinking Research Research is a big focus for our students. Every student takes an IA Research course their junior year where they are encouraged to collaborate in teams to complete their Pinnacle Project. In addition, students can choose to pursue the AP Capstone diploma which starts with 10th graders taking AP Seminar as their 10th grade ELA class. AP Seminar is followed by IA Research in 11th, and AP Research in 12th. Completion of the Pinnacle Research Project in 11th grade is one of the components of our magnet school requirements. Authentic, Project-Based Learning We engage students with complex topics in real-world scenarios, ask them to apply their knowledge, and pursue their passions whenever possible so the learning is relevant to them. Address Real-World Problems IA students interact with our community partners learning about actual problems community members are facing. For example, Fulton County Water Works worked with our freshman on Flex Fridays to talk about how natural and artificial water systems work. Students sampled the ponds on our property to determine if the pond system is healthy. If the pond was not healthy, they suggested solutions to improve the water health. Cross-Curricular Projects and Activities Students work on real-world challenges like delivering medical supplies to areas where first responders cannot reach. Health Science experts determine what needs to be included in the first response kit. Engineers work on the specs needed for the box of supplies that are delivered via drone, and information technology specialists program the drones. Work in Teams Students are encouraged to cooperate in teams to complete projects. Senior Simone W. explains: “We work on teams especially in my pathway classes. I’ve learned a lot about myself and how to work with different minds. I’m much more open and accepting to other people’s ideas now.” Explore more about our authentic learning experiences in the Beacon, our student written newsletter. Design Thinking Design Thinking is a method that uses a cyclical process to solve problems with the user in mind. DT uses a series of steps that create specific work in each phase.

If you have not yet scheduled your child’s booster shot and your child is 16 or will be turning 16, please put this on your to-do list. It's most convenient if you can go ahead and schedule it at the same time you schedule your child's well visit at the doctor. Local pharmacies may also provide this vaccine. When your child’s booster is done, please complete the Immunization Completion Form. You just need to provide your child’s name and birthdate and upload your form 3231. Any questions?

To attend IA, you must be a Fulton County resident living in Fulton Learning Zone 4, 5, 6, or 7. Students must apply to IA while they are in 8th grade. We only accept rising 9th grade students for admission. Students zoned to attend the following high schools can attend IA: Alpharetta, Cambridge, Centennial, Chattahoochee, Johns Creek, Milton, North Springs, Northview, Riverwood, and Roswell. When do I apply? The application process opens on December 9th and concludes on January 15th. I've applied. What happens next? Completion of Application Steps: Once your child has completed the online application, their name will be entered into a random lottery. This lottery is conducted to ensure a fair and equitable selection process for all applicants. Acceptance Emails: Following the lottery, FCS IA will send out an acceptance email on Friday, January 31st, to the first group of students who have been selected. We are thrilled at the prospect of welcoming new students to our community and are eager to see the unique contributions they will bring. Wait List: Students not included in the initial group of acceptances will be placed on a wait list. Please be assured that being on the wait list does not reflect on your child’s qualifications or potential. Enrollment Decisions: The first round of students will have the opportunity to either accept the invitation and enroll or decline. We understand that this is an important decision for your family, and we encourage you to consider the opportunity carefully. Further Invitations: Based on the number of students who accept the invitation, we will extend additional invitations to students from the wait list to enroll at Innovation Academy. Our goal is to fill our classrooms with enthusiastic learners, and we hope to offer this opportunity to as many students as possible. Rounds of Acceptance: Typically, we conduct three main rounds of acceptance. Depending on the circumstances, there may be additional rounds. We will keep you informed every step of the way. Siblings: We try to keep siblings together so if a rising freshman has a sibling who will be enrolled at IA next year when the student enrolls as a freshman, then the student will bypass the lottery. Rising freshman who have siblings who are currently seniors and will not have a sibling enrolled at IA next year will enter the lottery the same as everyone else. Siblings",
    "must complete an application to attend IA to be considered for enrollment. This sibling consideration is not automatically applied each year and can change in the future. How do I enroll at IA?

Finding the right school for you. First of all, do not buy-in to the idea that there is only one correct school for you. Students can find happiness and success at more than one school.

Back-Up, Match, and Reach Schools A good piece of advice is to design a list with back-up, match, and reach schools? A back-up school is a school where your academic course load, grades and college standardized test scores are at the top end of the accepted student's profile or a school that accepts most students who apply. A match school is a school where your academic and extracurricular profile falls into the middle to top range of accepted student profiles. This is a school where you fit the profile and have a good chance of being accepted. A reach school is a school that is extremely competitive like an Ivy league school or a school where your academic and extra-curricular profile is below or at the low-end of the accepted student profiles. Determine What is Important to You What is important to you? Small class sizes? Big football? A specific major? Staying close to home? Moving somewhere new? A big or small school? Cost of your",

    "Trip to Visit College Campuses Take a Campus Tour Once you've started focusing in on some schools that you are interested, plan a trip or more to go onto a school's campus and take a tour. You'll need to sign up for a tour ahead of time. These can get full so plan ahead. Schools often offer sessions from specific departments and majors that you can also sign up for. Long weekends and spring break of your junior year are great times to plan for a trip. Taking a Tour While IA is in Session Sometimes, it doesn't work out to take a tour while you are on break. You can still take a tour on campus. You must complete a Pre-Approved Absence Form and have it signed by school administration. Catch a Community-Sponsored College Info Session/Fair College Events Around Town Community organizations and colleges themselves often host college fairs and information sessions. These can be in person events in the metro Atlanta area or virtual sessions. Clusters of schools with similar profiles or geographical locations often travel together to different cities to host information sessions. Ivy league schools are less likely to attend each local high school, instead they will pick one or two locations in town and invite the entire student community to attend. Registration is usually required. Search your targeted schools' websites for information on how to visit or whether they have information sessions in the Atlanta area. If we hear about an information session, we will post it. PROBE Fair Many organizations host college fairs, but PROBE is an organization that usually hosts several in our area every year.

    "list of recommended courses for my student? Currently Enrolled Fulton County Schools Students If your student is currently enrolled in a Fulton County public school, then we will use the course recommendations that the middle school teachers input into Infinite Campus to create the student's schedule. The Innovation Academy scheduling process for rising 9th graders happens later than the process for your student's home school. Student's are automatically enrolled in their zoned home school and high schools can begin processing their schedule requests at the same time as their currently enrolled students. At FCSIA, we have to first get a form signed that students accept their seat, and then we need to work with the home school to have enrollment transferred. View the scheduling timeline tab for more information. Students Who Are Not Currently Enrolled in the FCS District but Will Be If your student is coming from a middle school that is not part of the Fulton County Schools system, then you need to upload your course recommendation form and academic records as part of the Fulton County online registration process. We will use your academic records and recommendations from your teachers to create a list of course recommendations. View the Scheduling timeline tab for more information.

The following are resources from that meeting. GSFC Slide Presentation Fall 2023 Federal Financial Aid Website How-to Create a FAFSA ID Scholarships Scholarship Tips: Focus on one or two scholarship websites/apps to make the process more manageable. Naviance, Gafutures.org, Scholly.com and Scholaroo.com are great options to search for scholarships geared toward your interests. Remember that many colleges and universities offer merit-based scholarships during the application process. Merit scholarships may be given out automatically to students who meet a specific GPA and test score criteria or awarded through a formal application process. Look at local scholarships offered through civic organizations or local businesses. HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarship HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships are provided to students who are Georgia residents and have demonstrated academic achievement. This money goes toward paying all or a portion of a student's tuition at a public State of Georgia institution and some private Georgia-based institutions. To find out more about HOPE eligibility, visit the GAfutures website. Students must provide a valid Social Security Number to be considered for the HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarships. When you login to GAfutures, the system will be unable to calculate your HOPE GPA to determine eligibility unless you have submitted a valid Social Security Card and number to the counseling office. The Georgia Student Finance Commission uses the Social Security Number to link to the transcript. FAFSA - Federal",
    "Application for Federal Student Aid The FAFSA (Federal Application for Federal Student Aid) is a free application and must be completed to qualify for federal financial aid. This form must be completed every year. You must complete either the FAFSA or the GSFAPP (Georgia Student Finance Application) to be eligible for the HOPE scholarship. GSFAPP - Georgia Student Finance Application GSFAPP (Georgia Student Finance Application) is one of the forms you can use to apply for HOPE and the Zell Miller scholarship. This application only needs to be completed once every 10 years. This application submits your information for the HOPE and Zell scholarships but does not qualify you for any federal financial aid. Upcoming Workshops / Events Peachtree Planning Workshops Georgia Student Finance Commission Providing Financial Aid Sessions Do you need help filling out the FAFSA? Have questions about financial aid? Attend a financial aid/FAFSA event at your local library. A Georgia Student Finance Commission representative will be available to help you.
